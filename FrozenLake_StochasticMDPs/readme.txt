This is the Frozen Lake learning agent, that learns in an environment that has stochastic Non-deterministic Markov Decision process. Taking an action has a probability distribution over the next states. 
We can think of this as a slippery floor problem, and makes the agent take actions that were not in its control (Environment Design!).
How does the agent find the optimal policy for such cases?
We use Q-Learning for this to train the agent. 
We have also shown how value based and LP algorithms can be used to solve such a problem.
